                    As you wake up, you and your friend find yourselves in absolute darkness. You feel something strapped to your arm and your friend seems to have the same feeling.
                    As you try to figure out what it is, your fingers make out a trigger. The moment you pull it, a blinding light emerges on the other side of the room.
                    You tell your friend to brace himself for another pull. Another light forms at the direction you aimed at. 
                    The entire room is made out of blocks, a lot of them furnished with spikes, others appealing more slippery than the ones you are sitting on. 
                    Your friend looks down on his arm and decides to test his own device. Nothing happens at first, but as he lifts his arm towards one of the walls, both of you spin around and fall towards the wall he was aiming at.
                    You look at each other for a moment and nod. Your only option out of this place, is to work together and find the exit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Exit This Way</b> is a 2-player cooperative, 3D platformer.
                    Light up the room and change gravity to find your way through procedurally generated test chambers.
                    As you experience the gameplay, you will enjoy the game as a perspective changing experience.
